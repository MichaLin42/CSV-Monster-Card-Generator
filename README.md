# Welcome to the CSV2MonsterCard project

The goal of this project is to develop a python script that will assist to create monster card data for [rpg-cards.vercel.app](https://rpg-cards.vercel.app). The moster cards will be compatible with the [Shadowdark RPG](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark).
The script will read a CSV file which contains the monster stats and convert it to a JSON file which can be then imported into the [rpg-cards.vercel.app](https://rpg-cards.vercel.app) card generator.


Example card output from [rpg-cards.vercel.app](https://rpg-cards.vercel.app):
